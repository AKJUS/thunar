What is it?
===========

Thunar is a modern file manager for the Unix/Linux desktop, aiming to be
easy-to-use and fast.


Required packages
=================

Thunar depends on the following packages:

 - perl 5.6 or above
 - GTK+ 2.6.0 or above
 - libexo 0.3.1 or above
 - intltool 0.30 or above
 - libpng12 1.2.0 or above
 - shared-mime-info 0.15 or above
 - desktop-file-utils 0.10 or above

Thunar can optionally use the following packages:

 - cairo 0.5 or above
 - gamin 0.1.0 or above
 - gconf 2.4 or above
 - libjpeg 6 or above
 - libstartup-notification 0.4 or above


Installation
============

The file 'INSTALL' contains generic installation instructions. For more
detailed information, visit the Thunar website at http://thunar.xfce.org/.


Debugging Support
=================

Thunar currently supports four different levels of debugging support, which
can be setup using the configure flag `--enable-debug' (check the output of
`configure --help'):

  `full'	Use this if you want to debug Thunar to locate a bug. The
  		build will most probably be noticably slower. This is also
		recommended for people that want to develop Thunar stuff.

  `yes'		This is the default for SVN snapshot builds. It adds all
  		kinds of checks to the code, and is therefore likely to run
		slower. Use this if you want to develop for Thunar (e.g.
		writing Thunar extensions and such).

  `minimum'	This is the default for release builds, and presents the
  		recommended behaviour.

  `no'		Disables all sanity checks. Don't use this unless you know
  		exactly what you do.


How to report bugs?
===================

Bugs should be reported to the Xfce bug tracking system
(http://bugzilla.xfce.org, product Thunar). You will need to
create an account for yourself.

Please read the HACKING file for information on where to send
changes or bugfixes for this package.
