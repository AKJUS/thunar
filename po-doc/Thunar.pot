For example, if <filename role=\"directory\">/etc/xdg</filename> is part of <envar>$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS</envar> (the default for most Linux distributions), you can install system wide defaults to <filename>/etc/xdg/Thunar/accels.scm</filename>. Thunar will then load shortcuts from this file on first startup."
