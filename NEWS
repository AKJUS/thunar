0.4.0rc1
========
- An implementation of the XDG Trash Specification was imported and is now
  used by both Thunar and xfdesktop to display and manage trashed files.
  The implementation is currently limited to the home trash, but that will
  be extended to support foreign trash cans soon.
- Add a trash panel applet for the Xfce panel, that displays the current
  state of the trash, allows to open and empty the trash, and supports
  drops of files to the trash.
- Add "No to all" response to the transfer progress dialog, which allows to
  skip all further overwrite dialogs (Bug #1666).
- Add ISO Speed Ratings to the Image page of the properties dialog.
- Add rubberband selection support to the detailed list view when build with
  GTK+ 2.9.0 and above (Bug #1996).
- Add menus to the "Back" and "Forward" buttons in the toolbar (Bug #1782).
- Update the path bar with the latest changes to GtkFileChooser (Bug #2060).
- The dependency of the thunar-vfs library on GConf is gone. Instead the
  available thumbnailers are now determined by an external tool and added to
  a cache file, which will be mapped by all processes using the thunar-vfs
  library (Bug #2131).
- Add a new thumbnailer for TrueType fonts using the FreeType 2.x library.
- Add a warning text to the window when running as super user (Bug #2218).
- Add desktop shortcut to the shortcuts pane and use a special icon for the
  desktop folder (Bug #2235).
- Use the new icon chooser dialog, available with exo 0.3.1.10rc1, to pick
  icons for custom actions.
- Fix invalid display of the file's group in the properties dialog (Bug #1838).
- Fix the location entry completion crashing with certain GTK+ versions (Bug
  #1891).
- Fix list model related crashes with GTK+ 2.10 (Gnome Bug #349128).
- Use CRLF for text/uri-list as specified by RFC 2483 (Bug #2166).
- Fix invalid substitution of %d in custom commands (Bug #2214).
- Fix not working Ctrl+A in the location entry (Bug #2036).
- Fix the progress bar text being truncated (Bug #2003).
- Fix missing mkdtemp on Solaris (Bug #2070).
- Fix compilation with compilers other than gcc (Bug #1852).
- Fix compilation on NetBSD 2.99 and above.
- Fix compilation on OpenBSD.
- Add manual page for Thunar (Bug #1650).
- Unmount volumes prior to ejecting them (Bug #2236).
- Do not use different icons to represent the home folder.
- Use "<folder> - File Manager" for the title of Thunar windows to make it
  easier to identify file manager windows in the taskbar.
- The thunar-vfs reference manual was updated to reflect the latest changes.
- Case sensitive sorting is now disabled by default (Bug #2064).
- Use a localized human readable format for the file dates (Bug #2057).
- Use the new GSlice allocator where possible to reduce memory overhead.
- Avoid the usage of GMemChunk, because in GLib 2.10 and above that is not
  only inefficient, but also continously leaks memory.

0.3.2beta2
==========
- The default operation when dropping files into a folder is now to move the
  files if both the source files and the target folder is on the same file
  system and the source files are owned by the user.
- The custom actions are now run using the shell.
- Added the "Send To" menu, which allows users to easily send files to other
  applications from within the file manager. Default targets are "Desktop
  (Create Link)", "Mail Recipient" and "Side Pane (Create Shortcut)". Additio-
  nal targets can be dynamically added via .desktop files.
- Support for session management was added.
- The "Open With" dialog now allows users to remove launchers that were
  previously added via the custom command box.
- The number of relocations for the libraries was reduced to improve the
  application startup time.
