==========
- The default operation when dropping files into a folder is now to move the
  files if both the source files and the target folder is on the same file
  system and the source files are owned by the user.
- The custom actions are now run using the shell.
- Added the "Send To" menu, which allows users to easily send files to other
  applications from within the file manager. Default targets are "Desktop
  (Create Link)", "Mail Recipient" and "Side Pane (Create Shortcut)". Additio-
  nal targets can be dynamically added via .desktop files.
- Support for session management was added.
- The "Open With" dialog now allows users to remove launchers that were
  previously added via the custom command box.
- The number of relocations for the libraries was reduced to improve the
  application startup time.
