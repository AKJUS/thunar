Thunar Wallpaper Plugin (thunar-wallpaper)
===========================================

The Thunar Wallpaper plugin is an extension to Thunar. It pulls the xfconf 
dependency required to set the correct settings on the Xfce4 desktop.

To disable this plugin (and the xfconf dependency that comes with it), pass 
--disable-wallpaper-plugin to ./configure.
