      Thunar is a new modern file manager for the Xfce Desktop Environment. Thunar has been designed from the ground up to
      be fast and easy-to-use. Its user interface is clean and intuitive, and does not include any confusing or useless
      options by default. Thunar is fast and responsive with a good start up time and folder load time.
    </para>

    <para>
      The Thunar file manager thereby provides an integrated access point to your files and applications. You can use the
      file manager to do the following:

    <sect2 id="thumbnailers">
      <title>Thumbnailers</title>

      <para>
        Thunar uses small utilities to create thumbnails of certain file types and displays the thumbnails as preview of the
        file content. These small tools are called thumbnailers. Thunar ships with thumbnailers for image and font files, and
        makes use of the installed thumbnailers from GNOME automatically if it was installed with support for <literal>gconf</literal>.
        Users may however dynamically extend this basic functionality with thumbnailers for additional file types.
      </para>

      <para>
        If you plan to write a custom thumbnailers, you need to start with a program that accepts atleast two command line parameters,
        the input file, which is of the file type you plan to support and the output file, which is a PNG file that complies with the
        format specified by the <ulink type="http" url="http://jens.triq.net/thumbnail-spec/creation.html#AEN139">Thumbnail Management
        Standard</ulink>. Additionally your program may also accept the desired size of the thumbnail, which is optional but highly
        recommended. If you write the output file at an arbitrary image size, Thunar will afterwards scale it to the desired size,
        which might produce a less optimal result than generating the thumbnail with the requested dimensions.
      </para>

      <para>
        Once your utility to generate the thumbnails is done, you will need to register your thumbnailer, so Thunar is able to locate
        and use it. Therefore all you need to do is to install a description file for the thumbnailer (a <filename>.desktop</filename> file)
        in one of the <filename role="directory">$XDG_DATA_DIRS/thumbnailers/</filename> paths. For example, if you want to register the
        thumbnailer for your user account only, you can install the file into the folder <filename
        role="directory">~/.local/share/thumbnailers/</filename>. The <filename>.desktop</filename> for thumbnailers has the following format.
      </para>

      <sect3 id="thumbnailer-desktop-file-format">
        <title>Thumbnailer Description File Format</title>

        <para>
          Thumbnailer description files utilize the <ulink type="http" url="http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/">Desktop
          Entry Format</ulink> with a special <literal>Type</literal> of <literal>X-Thumbnailer</literal> and special field
          <literal>X-Thumbnailer-Exec</literal> with new field codes. Basically, a thumbnailer description file has the following format.
        </para>

        <para>
          The <literal>Version</literal> and <literal>Encoding</literal> are mandated by the Desktop Entry Specification, just use the values shown
          in the example above. The <literal>Type</literal> field must have the special value <literal>X-Thumbnailer</literal>, otherwise your
          thumbnailer will not be recognized. The <literal>Name</literal> value describes your thumbnailer.
        </para>

        <para>
          The <literal>X-Thumbnailer-Exec</literal> field contains the command to run your thumbnailer, and supports certain field codes that will
          be substituted when the thumbnailer is run. Recognized field codes are as follows:

              The local path to the input file for which to create a thumbnail. May be either a path relative to the directory from which the
              thumbnailer was invoked or an absolute path.

            <listitem>
              The local path to the output file where to store the generated thumbnail. The output file must be written as valid PNG file according
              to the thumbnail standard (see above). Note that the path may not end with <literal>.png</literal>, which matters if you invoke certain
              third party tools.

            <term><varname>%u</varname></term>
            <listitem>
              Similar to <literal>%i</literal>, but substituted with the URI of the file, rather than the path. This was added for compatibility with
              GNOME.

        </variablelist>

        <para>
          You need to include atleast <literal>%o</literal> and <literal>%i</literal> or <literal>%u</literal>, otherwise your thumbnailer will
          be useless.
        </para>

        <para>
          The <literal>MimeType</literal> lists the MIME types - separated by semicolon - for which your thumbnailer is able to create previews.

      <sect3 id="eps-thumbnailer-example">
        <title>Example EPS Thumbnailer</title>

        <para>
          This example demonstrates how to write and install a new thumbnailer for <filename>.eps</filename> files, which uses the
          <command>convert</command> utility that ships as part of ImageMagick. First, we start with a simple script that invokes
          <command>convert</command> to generate a thumbnail at the requested size.
        </para>

        <programlisting>
#!/bin/sh
#
# eps-thumbnailer - Example thumbnailer script for EPS files.
#
# Usage: esp-thumbnailer eps-file png-file size
#

# command line parameters
ifile=$1
ofile=$2
size=$3

# invoke convert (ImageMagick)
exec convert "eps:$ifile" -scale "$sizex$size" "png:$ofile"</programlisting>

        <para>
          Save this script above to a file <filename>eps-thumbnailer</filename>, make sure the file is executable and install it
          to <filename role="directory">/usr/local/bin</filename>.
        </para>

        <screen>
$ chmod +x eps-thumbnailer
$ sudo install eps-thumbnailer /usr/local/bin/eps-thumbnailer</screen>

        <para>
          Next we need to create the thumbnail description file <filename>eps-thumbnailer.desktop</filename>, which looks like this:
        </para>

        <programlisting>
[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.0
Encoding=UTF-8
Type=X-Thumbnailer
Name=EPS Thumbnailer
TryExec=convert
MimeType=image/x-eps;
X-Thumbnailer-Exec=/usr/local/bin/eps-thumbnailer %i %o %s</programlisting>

        <para>
          This file must be installed to <filename role="directory">/usr/local/share/thumbnailers</filename> (create the folder if
          it does not exists).
        </para>

        <screen>
$ sudo install -d /usr/local/share/thumbnailers
$ sudo install eps-thumbnailer.desktop /usr/local/share/thumbnailers/eps-thumbnailer.desktop</screen>

        <para>
          The <filename>eps-thumbnailer.desktop</filename> file uses the special key <literal>TryExec</literal>, which, if specified,
          names a command that must be present on the system for the thumbnailer to be useful. In this case, our script is useless if
          the <command>convert</command> utility is not present.
        </para>

        <para>
          The last step is to regenerate the thumbnailer cache, so Thunar will pick up our thumbnailer. The thumbnailer cache is located
          at <filename>$XDG_CACHE_HOME/Thunar/thumbnailers.cache</filename> (unless overridden by your or your system administrator, the
          <varname>$XDG_CACHE_HOME</varname> points to the folder <filename role="directory">~/.cache/</filename>). The thumbnailers
          cache is regenerated periodically by Thunar, but you can force to regenerate it by invoking the
          <filename>thunar-vfs-update-thumbnailers-cache-1</filename> utility, that ships as part of Thunar. This utility is usually installed
          in the <filename role="directory">libexec</filename> subfolder of your installation prefix (<filename role="directory">sbin</filename>
          on Debian/Ubuntu). So for example, if Thunar is installed in <filename role="directory">/usr</filename>, invoke the utility as
          follows:
        </para>

        <screen>$ /usr/libexec/thunar-vfs-update-thumbnailers-cache-1</screen>

        <para>
          But make sure you run the program from your user account, not the superuser account, since the thumbnailers cache is stored in
          your home folder, rather than a system wide location.
        </para>

        <para>
          Now, if Thunar is compiled with support for file alteration monitoring (using the FAM or Gamin services), it will automatically
          pick up the new thumbnailers cache within a few seconds and afterwards be able to generate thumbnails using your custom
          thumbnailers. Otherwise you might need to completely restart Thunar to apply the changes, using
        </para>

        <screen>$ Thunar -q</screen>

        <para>
          to terminate any running instance, and afterwards restart it from your launcher.
        </para>

        <screen>$ rm -rf ~/.thumbnails/</screen>

        <para>
          which will also give you some free space in your home folder. Since all the information stored within this folder was automatically
          generated from files in your file system, you will not loose any sensitive data.

    <sect2 id="the-unix-file-system">
      <title>The UNIX File System</title>

      <para>
        While the Thunar file manager does a good job at abstracting the details of the underlying file system, so the user
        does not need to care about them, it is sometimes useful to understand the basic concepts to get the whole picture.
        This section tries to give a brief introduction to the concepts of the UNIX file system, which is used today by all
        incarnations of UNIX, including Linux.
      </para>

      <sect3 id="folders-and-paths">
        <title>Folders and Paths</title>

        <para>
          In a UNIX file system all folders are arranged in a simple inverted tree structure descending and branching down
          from a single top level folder, which is called the <emphasis>root directory</emphasis> (the term
          <emphasis>directory</emphasis> is often used instead of <emphasis>folder</emphasis>) and displayed as
          <guilabel>File System</guilabel> in Thunar. This means that you can get from any folder to any other by going
          up the tree until you reach a common point, then down the tree through the appropriate subfolders until you reach
          your target.
        </para>

        <para>
          The position of any file or folder in the tree can be described by its <emphasis>path</emphasis>. The path is the
          list of folders you would have to descend through to get to the target folder or file, starting from the top level
          folder. For example <filename role="directory">/home/luke</filename> is the subfolder <filename
          role="directory">luke</filename> of the subfolder <filename role="directory">home</filename> of the top level folder,
          and <filename>/home/luke/myfile.txt</filename> is the file <filename>myfile.txt</filename> in that subfolder. The
          leading <filename role="directory">/</filename> in these paths represents the top level folder.
        </para>

        <para>
          Every user has their own folder to hold their personal files and settings. This folder is called the <emphasis>home
          directory</emphasis> and is displayed in Thunar as special icon with the users login name. The folder is similar to
          the <guilabel>My Files</guilabel> folder known from Windows. The <emphasis>home directories</emphasis> of the various
          users in a system are usually located below the <filename role="directory">/home</filename> folder. For example
          <filename role="directory">/home/luke</filename> would be the home directory of the user with the login name
          <filename role="directory">luke</filename>, while <filename role="directory">/home/jane</filename> would be
          the home directory for the user with the login name <filename role="directory">jane</filename>.
        </para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3 id="file-types">
        <title>File Types</title>

        <para>
          You may have already heard that everything is a file in UNIX. This is true for most objects present in UNIX systems
          today. In fact even devices are represented as a special files. While this may not make sense at first sight, it is
          one of the strengths of UNIX and its derivates, and has helped it to maintain a simple core over the years where other
          operating systems had to introduce new concepts for every new technology.
        </para>

        <para>
          These are the four most important types of files in the UNIX file system.
        </para>

          <title>Ordinary Files</title>

          <para>
            An ordinary file may contain text, a program or other data. This includes image files, audio files, office documents
            and video files. The term <emphasis>file</emphasis> is often used to refer to an ordinary file.
          </para>

        <sect4 id="file-types-folder-files">
          <title>Folder Files</title>

          <para>
            Folders are also files in the UNIX file system. To be exact a folder is a special file, which contains a
            mapping of file names to file references for every file contained within this folder.
          </para>

        <sect4 id="file-types-symbolic-link-files">
          <title>Symbolic Link Files</title>

          <para>
            A Symbolic link (often called a <emphasis>symlink</emphasis>) is a special file that contains a path to
            another file in the file system. Symbolic link files therefore do not contain any useful information
            themselves, but just refer to other files.

          <title>Device Files</title>

            As mentioned earlier (most) devices are also accessed through the file system. These special device files are
            usually located in the <filename role="directory">/dev</filename> folder. For example the special file
            <filename>/dev/hda</filename> represents the first IDE disk on Linux.

    <sect3 id="faq-executables">
      <title>Why doesn't Thunar execute files marked as executable?</title>

      <para>
        For security reasons Thunar only executes files of type <literal>application/x-desktop</literal>,
        <literal>application/x-executable</literal> and <literal>application/x-shellscript</literal>. For
        desktop files the execution feature will only be enabled if the desktop file is of type
        <literal>Application</literal> and a valid <literal>Exec</literal> line is given or of type
        <literal>Link</literal> and a valid <literal>URL</literal> is given. For the other types the feature
        is available if the file is marked executable for the current user.
      </para>

      <para>
        Also note that for <literal>application/x-executable</literal> and <literal>application/x-shellscript</literal>,
        the types of the file don't really need to match these types exactly, but it is suffice if the detected
        type has a parent that matches one of the two types listed above, or if the MIME-type is an alias for
        one of the above.

    <sect3 id="faq-metadata">
      <title>Where does Thunar store the metadata associated with files?</title>

      <para>
        Thunar associates various settings with files/folders, which we call metadata.
        This metadata for all files is stored in tdb database file, which is called
        the metafile. The database file is stored in
        <filename>$XDG_CACHE_HOME/Thunar/metafile.tdb</filename> and can be examined
        using the <command>tdbtool</command>, which is part of the Thunar distribution

        Thunar currently features basic support for so called <emphasis>mouse gestures</emphasis>
        in its icon view. You can use these <emphasis>mouse gestures</emphasis> by holding down
        the middle mouse button (usually the mouse wheel) while the mouse pointer is on the
        background area of the icon view component (any area that is not covered by
        an icon or a text). Now you can move the cursor into four directions to

        If the shortcut doesn't change, then you need to enable the feature in
        GTK+. This can be achieved in 3 ways:

      <title>Where does Thunar store the keyboard shortcuts?</title>

      <para>
        The custom keyboard shortcuts are stored in the standard GTK+ accel map format in a
        file located at <filename>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Thunar/accels.scm</filename>. Lines starting
        with <literal>;</literal> are comments. See the GTK+ documentation for details about the
        file format.
      </para>

      <para>
        If you are a packager or a system administrator and want to provide a system wide default
        for the keyboard shortcuts, that is different from the default shortcuts in Thunar, you
        can create a file <filename>Thunar/accels.scm</filename> in one of the <envar>$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS</envar>.
        For example, if <filename role="directory">/etc/xdg</filename> is part of <envar>$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS</envar>
        (the default for most Linux distributions), you can install system wide defaults to
        <filename>/etc/xdg/Thunar/accels.scm</filename>. Thunar will then load shortcuts from this file on first startup.

      Remember that useful bug reports are ones that get bugs fixed, so a useful bug report has two qualities:
    </para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Reproducible.</emphasis> If the developer cannot see the bug himself
          to prove that it exists, he will most probably not be able to fix it at all. Every detail you
          can provide helps.

      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Specific.</emphasis> The quicker the developer can isolate the problem
          to a specific area, the more likely he will expediently fix it.

    </itemizedlist>

    <para>
      In case you want to request a new feature, please make clear why you consider it a worth
      addition for the application. It is more likely that a new feature gets added if you provide
      good arguments for the feature. It will increase the chance of addition even more if you
      provide a patch that implements the requested feature, but make sure that you read the file
      <ulink type="http" url="http://svn.xfce.org/svn/xfce/terminal/trunk/HACKING">HACKING</ulink>
      - especially the section labeled <emphasis>Coding Style</emphasis> - before you start hacking
      up the source.
