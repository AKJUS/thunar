    <para>
      Thunar is a new modern file manager for the Xfce Desktop Environment. Thunar has been designed from the ground up to
      be fast and easy-to-use. Its user interface is clean and intuitive, and does not include any confusing or useless
      options by default. Thunar is fast and responsive with a good start up time and folder load time.
    </para>

    <para>
      The Thunar file manager thereby provides an integrated access point to your files and applications. You can use the
      file manager to do the following:

    <sect2 id="the-unix-file-system">
      <title>The UNIX File System</title>

      <para>
        While the Thunar file manager does a good job at abstracting the details of the underlying file system, so the user
        does not need to care about them, it is sometimes useful to understand the basic concepts to get the whole picture.
        This section tries to give a brief introduction to the concepts of the UNIX file system, which is used today by all
        incarnations of UNIX, including Linux.
      </para>

      <sect3 id="folders-and-paths">
        <title>Folders and Paths</title>

        <para>
          In a UNIX file system all folders are arranged in a simple inverted tree structure descending and branching down
          from a single top level folder, which is called the <emphasis>root directory</emphasis> (the term
          <emphasis>directory</emphasis> is often used instead of <emphasis>folder</emphasis>) and displayed as
          <guilabel>File System</guilabel> in Thunar. This means that you can get from any folder to any other by going
          up the tree until you reach a common point, then down the tree through the appropriate subfolders until you reach
          your target.
        </para>

        <para>
          The position of any file or folder in the tree can be described by its <emphasis>path</emphasis>. The path is the
          list of folders you would have to descend through to get to the target folder or file, starting from the top level
          folder. For example <filename role="directory">/home/luke</filename> is the subfolder <filename
          role="directory">luke</filename> of the subfolder <filename role="directory">home</filename> of the top level folder,
          and <filename>/home/luke/myfile.txt</filename> is the file <filename>myfile.txt</filename> in that subfolder. The
          leading <filename role="directory">/</filename> in these paths represents the top level folder.
        </para>

        <para>
          Every user has their own folder to hold their personal files and settings. This folder is called the <emphasis>home
          directory</emphasis> and is displayed in Thunar as special icon with the users login name. The folder is similar to
          the <guilabel>My Files</guilabel> folder known from Windows. The <emphasis>home directories</emphasis> of the various
          users in a system are usually located below the <filename role="directory">/home</filename> folder. For example
          <filename role="directory">/home/luke</filename> would be the home directory of the user with the login name
          <filename role="directory">luke</filename>, while <filename role="directory">/home/jane</filename> would be
          the home directory for the user with the login name <filename role="directory">jane</filename>.
        </para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3 id="file-types">
        <title>File Types</title>

        <para>
          You may have already heard that everything is a file in UNIX. This is true for most objects present in UNIX systems
          today. In fact even devices are represented as a special files. While this may not make sense at first sight, it is
          one of the strengths of UNIX and its derivates, and has helped it to maintain a simple core over the years where other
          operating systems had to introduce new concepts for every new technology.
        </para>

        <para>
          These are the four most important types of files in the UNIX file system.
        </para>

        <sect4 id="file-types-ordinary-files">
          <title>Ordinary Files</title>

          <para>
            An ordinary file may contain text, a program or other data. This includes image files, audio files, office documents
            and video files. The term <emphasis>file</emphasis> is often used to refer to an ordinary file.
          </para>
        </sect4>

        <sect4 id="file-types-folder-files">
          <title>Folder Files</title>

          <para>
            Folders are also files in the UNIX file system. To be exact a folder is a special file, which contains a
            mapping of file names to file references for every file contained within this folder.
          </para>
        </sect4>

        <sect4 id="file-types-symbolic-link-files">
          <title>Symbolic Link Files</title>

          <para>
            A Symbolic link (often called a <emphasis>symlink</emphasis>) is a special file that contains a path to
            another file in the file system. Symbolic link files therefore do not contain any useful information
            themselves, but just refer to other files.
          </para>
        </sect4>

        <sect4 id="file-types-device-files">
          <title>Device Files</title>

          <para>
            As mentioned earlier (most) devices are also accessed through the file system. These special device files are
            usually located in the <filename role="directory">/dev</filename> folder. For example the special file
            <filename>/dev/hda</filename> represents the first IDE disk on Linux.
          </para>
        </sect4>
      </sect3>

  <sect1 id="faq">
    <title>Frequently Asked Questions</title>

    <para>
      The intent of this section is to collect the quite numerous frequently asked
      questions that relate to working with Thunar. If you know of a question that
      is missing from this page, please <ulink type="http"
      url="http://bugzilla.xfce.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Thunar&amp;format=guided">file
      a request</ulink>.
    </para>

    <sect3 id="faq-executables">
      <title>Why doesn't Thunar execute files marked as executable?</title>

      <para>
        For security reasons Thunar only executes files of type <literal>application/x-desktop</literal>,
        <literal>application/x-executable</literal> and <literal>application/x-shellscript</literal>. For
        desktop files the execution feature will only be enabled if the desktop file is of type
        <literal>Application</literal> and a valid <literal>Exec</literal> line is given or of type
        <literal>Link</literal> and a valid <literal>URL</literal> is given. For the other types the feature
        is available if the file is marked executable for the current user.
      </para>

      <para>
        Also note that for <literal>application/x-executable</literal> and <literal>application/x-shellscript</literal>,
        the types of the file don't really need to match these types exactly, but it is suffice if the detected
        type has a parent that matches one of the two types listed above, or if the MIME-type is an alias for
        one of the above.
      </para>
    </sect3>

    <sect3 id="faq-metadata">
      <title>Where does Thunar store the metadata associated with files?</title>

      <para>
        Thunar associates various settings with files/folders, which we call metadata.
        This metadata for all files is stored in tdb database file, which is called
        the metafile. The database file is stored in
        <filename>$XDG_CACHE_HOME/Thunar/metafile.tdb</filename> and can be examined
        using the <command>tdbtool</command>, which is part of the Thunar distribution
        (located in the <filename role="directory">tdb/</filename> subdirectory).
      </para>
    </sect3>

    <sect3 id="faq-thunarrc">
      <title>Where does Thunar store its preferences?</title>

      <para>
        Thunar stores the user configurable preferences (and hidden settings) in
        an <filename>.ini</filename> file, which is located at
        <filename>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Thunar/thunarrc</filename> and can be examined
        using a text editor. See <filename>docs/README.thunarrc</filename> for an
        overview of the various preferences.
      </para>
    </sect3>

    <sect3 id="faq-mouse-gestures">
      <title>How to use mouse gestures in Thunar?</title>

      <para>
        Thunar currently features basic support for so called <emphasis>mouse gestures</emphasis>
        in its icon view. You can use these <emphasis>mouse gestures</emphasis> by holding down
        the middle mouse button (usually the mouse wheel) while the mouse pointer is on the
        background area of the icon view component (any area that is not covered by
        an icon or a text). Now you can move the cursor into four directions to
        perform certain actions, which are described below.
      </para>

      <simplelist>
        <member><guilabel>Left</guilabel> - opens the previous visited folder</member>
        <member><guilabel>Up</guilabel> - opens the parent folder</member>
        <member><guilabel>Right</guilabel> - opens the next visited folder</member>
        <member><guilabel>Down</guilabel> - reloads the current folder</member>

      Remember that useful bug reports are ones that get bugs fixed, so a useful bug report has two qualities:
    </para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Reproducible.</emphasis> If the developer cannot see the bug himself
          to prove that it exists, he will most probably not be able to fix it at all. Every detail you
          can provide helps.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Specific.</emphasis> The quicker the developer can isolate the problem
          to a specific area, the more likely he will expediently fix it.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>
      In case you want to request a new feature, please make clear why you consider it a worth
      addition for the application. It is more likely that a new feature gets added if you provide
      good arguments for the feature. It will increase the chance of addition even more if you
      provide a patch that implements the requested feature, but make sure that you read the file
      <ulink type="http" url="http://svn.xfce.org/svn/xfce/terminal/trunk/HACKING">HACKING</ulink>
      - especially the section labeled <emphasis>Coding Style</emphasis> - before you start hacking
      up the source.
