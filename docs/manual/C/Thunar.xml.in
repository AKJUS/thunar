    <para>
      Thunar is a new modern file manager for the Xfce Desktop Environment. Thunar has been designed from the ground up to
      be fast and easy-to-use. Its user interface is clean and intuitive, and does not include any confusing or useless
      options by default. Thunar is fast and responsive with a good start up time and folder load time.
    </para>

    <para>
      The Thunar file manager thereby provides an integrated access point to your files and applications. You can use the
      file manager to do the following:

    <sect2 id="the-unix-file-system">
      <title>The UNIX File System</title>

      <para>
        While the Thunar file manager does a good job at abstracting the details of the underlying file system, so the user
        does not need to care about them, it is sometimes useful to understand the basic concepts to get the whole picture.
        This section tries to give a brief introduction to the concepts of the UNIX file system, which is used today by all
        incarnations of UNIX, including Linux.
      </para>

      <sect3 id="folders-and-paths">
        <title>Folders and Paths</title>

        <para>
          In a UNIX file system all folders are arranged in a simple inverted tree structure descending and branching down
          from a single top level folder, which is called the <emphasis>root directory</emphasis> (the term
          <emphasis>directory</emphasis> is often used instead of <emphasis>folder</emphasis>) and displayed as
          <guilabel>File System</guilabel> in Thunar. This means that you can get from any folder to any other by going
          up the tree until you reach a common point, then down the tree through the appropriate subfolders until you reach
          your target.
        </para>

        <para>
          The position of any file or folder in the tree can be described by its <emphasis>path</emphasis>. The path is the
          list of folders you would have to descend through to get to the target folder or file, starting from the top level
          folder. For example <filename role="directory">/home/luke</filename> is the subfolder <filename
          role="directory">luke</filename> of the subfolder <filename role="directory">home</filename> of the top level folder,
          and <filename>/home/luke/myfile.txt</filename> is the file <filename>myfile.txt</filename> in that subfolder. The
          leading <filename role="directory">/</filename> in these paths represents the top level folder.
        </para>

        <para>
          Every user has their own folder to hold their personal files and settings. This folder is called the <emphasis>home
          directory</emphasis> and is displayed in Thunar as special icon with the users login name. The folder is similar to
          the <guilabel>My Files</guilabel> folder known from Windows. The <emphasis>home directories</emphasis> of the various
          users in a system are usually located below the <filename role="directory">/home</filename> folder. For example
          <filename role="directory">/home/luke</filename> would be the home directory of the user with the login name
          <filename role="directory">luke</filename>, while <filename role="directory">/home/jane</filename> would be
          the home directory for the user with the login name <filename role="directory">jane</filename>.
        </para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3 id="file-types">
        <title>File Types</title>

        <para>
          You may have already heard that everything is a file in UNIX. This is true for most objects present in UNIX systems
          today. In fact even devices are represented as a special files. While this may not make sense at first sight, it is
          one of the strengths of UNIX and its derivates, and has helped it to maintain a simple core over the years where other
          operating systems had to introduce new concepts for every new technology.
        </para>

        <para>
          These are the four most important types of files in the UNIX file system.
        </para>

        <sect4 id="file-types-ordinary-files">
          <title>Ordinary Files</title>

          <para>
            An ordinary file may contain text, a program or other data. This includes image files, audio files, office documents
            and video files. The term <emphasis>file</emphasis> is often used to refer to an ordinary file.
          </para>
        </sect4>

        <sect4 id="file-types-folder-files">
          <title>Folder Files</title>

          <para>
            Folders are also files in the UNIX file system. To be exact a folder is a special file, which contains a
            mapping of file names to file references for every file contained within this folder.
          </para>
        </sect4>

        <sect4 id="file-types-symbolic-link-files">
          <title>Symbolic Link Files</title>

          <para>
            A Symbolic link (often called a <emphasis>symlink</emphasis>) is a special file that contains a path to
            another file in the file system. Symbolic link files therefore do not contain any useful information
            themselves, but just refer to other files.
          </para>
        </sect4>

        <sect4 id="file-types-device-files">
          <title>Device Files</title>

          <para>
            As mentioned earlier (most) devices are also accessed through the file system. These special device files are
            usually located in the <filename role="directory">/dev</filename> folder. For example the special file
            <filename>/dev/hda</filename> represents the first IDE disk on Linux.
          </para>
        </sect4>
      </sect3>
    </sect2>

    <para>
      To report a bug or to make a suggestion regarding this application or this manual, use the bug tracking system at <ulink
      url="http://bugzilla.xfce.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Thunar&amp;format=guided">http://bugzilla.xfce.org/</ulink>.
      Remember that useful bug reports are ones that get bugs fixed, so a useful bug report has two qualities:
    </para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Reproducible.</emphasis> If the developer cannot see the bug himself
          to prove that it exists, he will most probably not be able to fix it at all. Every detail you
          can provide helps.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Specific.</emphasis> The quicker the developer can isolate the problem
          to a specific area, the more likely he will expediently fix it.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>
      In case you want to request a new feature, please make clear why you consider it a worth
      addition for the application. It is more likely that a new feature gets added if you provide
      good arguments for the feature. It will increase the chance of addition even more if you
      provide a patch that implements the requested feature, but make sure that you read the file
      <ulink type="http" url="http://svn.xfce.org/svn/xfce/terminal/trunk/HACKING">HACKING</ulink>
      - especially the section labeled <emphasis>Coding Style</emphasis> - before you start hacking
      up the source.

      Else, if you have questions about the use or installation of this software, please ask on the

      list</ulink> or point your IRC client to <emphasis role="bold">irc.freenode.net</emphasis>,
      join the channel <emphasis role="bold">#thunar</emphasis> and ask for help.
