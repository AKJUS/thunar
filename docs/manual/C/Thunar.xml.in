    <para>
      Thunar is a new modern file manager for the Xfce Desktop Environment. Thunar has been designed from the ground up to
      be fast and easy-to-use. Its user interface is clean and intuitive, and does not include any confusing or useless
      options by default. Thunar is fast and responsive with a good start up time and folder load time.
    </para>

    <para>
      The Thunar file manager thereby provides an integrated access point to your files and applications. You can use the
      file manager to do the following:

    <title>Using Removable Media</title>

    <sect2 id="accessing-removable-media">
      <title>Accessing Removable Media</title>

      <para>
        Thunar supports removable media if it was built with support for <ulink type="http" url="http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software_2fhal">HAL</ulink>,
        or if you are using <ulink type="http" url="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</ulink>. Note however that on FreeBSD 6.0 or newer, it is
        suggested to use HAL rather than the native support provided by Thunar.
      </para>

      <sect3 id="to-mount-media">
        <title>To Mount Media</title>

        <para>
          To <emphasis>mount</emphasis> media is to make the file system of the media available for access. When you mount media, the
          file system of the media is attached as a subdirectory to your file system.
        </para>

        <para>
          To access media, insert the media in the appropriate device, or connect the new device to your computer (i.e. connect an USB
          stick to one of your USB ports). An object that represents the media is added to the side pane of the file manager. If
          <application>xfdesktop</application> is running and configured to display <guilabel>File/launcher icons</guilabel> this
          object will also be added to your desktop.
        </para>

        <para>
          To actually mount the media, click on the object that represents the media. For example, to mount a floppy diskette,
          click on the <guilabel>Floppy Disk</guilabel> object in the side pane. The file manager will now add the file system
          of the media to your file system hierarchy and display the contents of the floppy diskette in the main area.
        </para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3 id="to-eject-media">
        <title>To Eject Media</title>

        <para>
          If the drive for the media is a motorized drive (i.e. a CD-ROM drive), right-click on the media object in the side pane
          or on the desktop and choose <guilabel>Eject Volume</guilabel>. The media is ejected from the drive after a few seconds.
          If the drive for the media is not motorized (i.e. a floppy drive or an USB stick), right-click on the media object and
          choose <guilabel>Unmount Volume</guilabel>. After a short period of time, a notification will appear to inform you
          that it is now safe to remove the media or disconnect the drive from the computer.
        </para>

        <para>
          However this notification will only be displayed if support for <application>libnotify</application> is enabled,
          and you have installed a notification daemon. A notification daemon for Xfce is available from the <ulink type="http"
          url="http://goodies.xfce.org/projects/applications/notification-daemon-xfce">Xfce Goodies Project</ulink>.
          If notification support is not available, wait until the context menu disappears before you remove the media or disconnect
          the drive.
        </para>

        <para>
          Be aware that you cannot eject or unmount media that is still in use by one or more applications. Therefore if the file
          manager refuses to eject media, make sure you close all applications that were accessing the media, and be sure to also
          check command line applications running in <application>Terminal</application> windows.
        </para>

        <para>
          Make sure to unmount removable media before ejecting. Do not eject a diskette from the floppy drive before your unmount
          the diskette. Do not remove an USB stick before you unmount the flash drive. If you do not unmount the media first you
          might lose data or cause your system to crash.

      <title>Management of Removable Drives and Media</title>

      <para>
        Thunar is also able to automatically manage removable drives and media if the <ulink type="http"
        url="http://www.foo-projects.org/~benny/projects/thunar-volman/index.html">thunar-volman</ulink> package is installed on
        your system.  Note however that this feature requires HAL support.
      </para>

      <para>
        Now, if HAL support is available and <application>thunar-volman</application> is installed on your system, you
        can choose to enable the <guilabel>Volume Management</guilabel> feature of Thunar. Therefore, open the file
        manager preferences, go to the <guilabel>Advanced</guilabel> page and check the <guilabel>Enable Volume
        Management</guilabel> button.
      </para>

      <para>
        The next step is to customize the management of removable drives and media to your needs. Click on the
        <guilabel>Configure</guilabel> link in the <guilabel>Volume Management</guilabel> section, right below
        the button. The <guilabel>Removable Drives and Media</guilabel> configuration dialog will be displayed.

        The preferences are divided by device categories to make it easy to locate the option for you specific
        device.
      </para>

      <para>
        The <guilabel>Storage</guilabel> page contains the most important options. As the name suggests these
        options apply only to storage devices like external harddisk drives, USB sticks and CD-ROMs. The
        <guilabel>Removable Storage</guilabel> options are described in detail below.

            </para>
            <para>
              This option must be enabled for certain other features to work with removable drives. For example,
              if you disable this option, certain kinds of portable music players cannot be detected any more and
              so, even if you enabled the <guilabel>Play music files when connected</guilabel> option on the
              <guilabel>Multimedia</guilabel> page, the specified command will not be run when you hot-plug your
              portable music player.

            </para>
            <para>
              This option must be enabled for certain other features to work with removable media. For example,
              if you disable this option, it is impossible to detect whether the removable media has auto-run
              capabilities, and so the <guilabel>Auto-run programs on new drives and media</guilabel> option
              has no effect for removable media.

              Note however, that the contents will only be displayed if no other action was possible or you
              choose to ignore the other possible actions. For example, if you insert a CD-ROM with auto-run
              capabilities and the <guilabel>Auto-run programs on new drives and media</guilabel> option is
              enabled, you will be prompted whether you want to allow or ignore the auto-run. If you choose

    <sect2 id="thumbnailers">
      <title>Thumbnailers</title>

      <para>
        Thunar uses small utilities to create thumbnails of certain file types and displays the thumbnails as preview of the
        file content. These small tools are called thumbnailers. Thunar ships with thumbnailers for image and font files, and
        makes use of the installed thumbnailers from GNOME automatically if it was installed with support for <literal>gconf</literal>.
        Users may however dynamically extend this basic functionality with thumbnailers for additional file types.
      </para>

      <para>
        If you plan to write a custom thumbnailers, you need to start with a program that accepts atleast two command line parameters,
        the input file, which is of the file type you plan to support and the output file, which is a PNG file that complies with the
        format specified by the <ulink type="http" url="http://jens.triq.net/thumbnail-spec/creation.html#AEN139">Thumbnail Management
        Standard</ulink>. Additionally your program may also accept the desired size of the thumbnail, which is optional but highly
        recommended. If you write the output file at an arbitrary image size, Thunar will afterwards scale it to the desired size,
        which might produce a less optimal result than generating the thumbnail with the requested dimensions.
      </para>

      <para>
        Once your utility to generate the thumbnails is done, you will need to register your thumbnailer, so Thunar is able to locate
        and use it. Therefore all you need to do is to install a description file for the thumbnailer (a <filename>.desktop</filename> file)
        in one of the <filename role="directory">$XDG_DATA_DIRS/thumbnailers/</filename> paths. For example, if you want to register the
        thumbnailer for your user account only, you can install the file into the folder <filename
        role="directory">~/.local/share/thumbnailers/</filename>. The <filename>.desktop</filename> for thumbnailers has the following format.
      </para>

        <title>Example EPS Thumbnailer</title>

        <para>
          This example demonstrates how to write and install a new thumbnailer for <filename>.eps</filename> files, which uses the
          <command>convert</command> utility that ships as part of ImageMagick. First, we start with a simple script that invokes
          <command>convert</command> to generate a thumbnail at the requested size.
        </para>

        <programlisting>
#!/bin/sh
#
# eps-thumbnailer - Example thumbnailer script for EPS files.
#
# Usage: esp-thumbnailer eps-file png-file size
#

# command line parameters
ifile=$1
ofile=$2
size=$3

# invoke convert (ImageMagick)
exec convert "eps:$ifile" -scale "$sizex$size" "png:$ofile"</programlisting>

        <para>
          Save this script above to a file <filename>eps-thumbnailer</filename>, make sure the file is executable and install it
          to <filename role="directory">/usr/local/bin</filename>.
        </para>

        <screen>
$ chmod +x eps-thumbnailer
$ sudo install eps-thumbnailer /usr/local/bin/eps-thumbnailer</screen>

        <para>
          Next we need to create the thumbnail description file <filename>eps-thumbnailer.desktop</filename>, which looks like this:
        </para>

        <programlisting>
[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.0
Encoding=UTF-8
Type=X-Thumbnailer
Name=EPS Thumbnailer
TryExec=convert
MimeType=image/x-eps;
X-Thumbnailer-Exec=/usr/local/bin/eps-thumbnailer %i %o %s</programlisting>

        <para>
          This file must be installed to <filename role="directory">/usr/local/share/thumbnailers</filename> (create the folder if
          it does not exists).
        </para>

        <screen>
$ sudo install -d /usr/local/share/thumbnailers
$ sudo install eps-thumbnailer.desktop /usr/local/share/thumbnailers/eps-thumbnailer.desktop</screen>

        <para>
          The <filename>eps-thumbnailer.desktop</filename> file uses the special key <literal>TryExec</literal>, which, if specified,
          names a command that must be present on the system for the thumbnailer to be useful. In this case, our script is useless if
          the <command>convert</command> utility is not present.
        </para>

        <para>
          The last step is to regenerate the thumbnailer cache, so Thunar will pick up our thumbnailer. The thumbnailer cache is located
          at <filename>$XDG_CACHE_HOME/Thunar/thumbnailers.cache</filename> (unless overridden by your or your system administrator, the
          <varname>$XDG_CACHE_HOME</varname> points to the folder <filename role="directory">~/.cache/</filename>). The thumbnailers
          cache is regenerated periodically by Thunar, but you can force to regenerate it by invoking the
          <filename>thunar-vfs-update-thumbnailers-cache-1</filename> utility, that ships as part of Thunar. This utility is usually installed
          in the <filename role="directory">libexec</filename> subfolder of your installation prefix (<filename role="directory">sbin</filename>
          on Debian/Ubuntu). So for example, if Thunar is installed in <filename role="directory">/usr</filename>, invoke the utility as
          follows:
        </para>

        <screen>$ /usr/libexec/thunar-vfs-update-thumbnailers-cache-1</screen>

        <para>
          But make sure you run the program from your user account, not the superuser account, since the thumbnailers cache is stored in
          your home folder, rather than a system wide location.
        </para>

        <para>
          Now, if Thunar is compiled with support for file alteration monitoring (using the FAM or Gamin services), it will automatically
          pick up the new thumbnailers cache within a few seconds and afterwards be able to generate thumbnails using your custom
          thumbnailers. Otherwise you might need to completely restart Thunar to apply the changes, using
        </para>

        <screen>$ Thunar -q</screen>

        <para>
          to terminate any running instance, and afterwards restart it from your launcher.

      <title>The UNIX File System</title>

      <para>
        While the Thunar file manager does a good job at abstracting the details of the underlying file system, so the user
        does not need to care about them, it is sometimes useful to understand the basic concepts to get the whole picture.
        This section tries to give a brief introduction to the concepts of the UNIX file system, which is used today by all
        incarnations of UNIX, including Linux.
      </para>

      <sect3 id="folders-and-paths">
        <title>Folders and Paths</title>

        <para>
          In a UNIX file system all folders are arranged in a simple inverted tree structure descending and branching down
          from a single top level folder, which is called the <emphasis>root directory</emphasis> (the term
          <emphasis>directory</emphasis> is often used instead of <emphasis>folder</emphasis>) and displayed as
          <guilabel>File System</guilabel> in Thunar. This means that you can get from any folder to any other by going
          up the tree until you reach a common point, then down the tree through the appropriate subfolders until you reach
          your target.
        </para>

        <para>
          The position of any file or folder in the tree can be described by its <emphasis>path</emphasis>. The path is the
          list of folders you would have to descend through to get to the target folder or file, starting from the top level
          folder. For example <filename role="directory">/home/luke</filename> is the subfolder <filename
          role="directory">luke</filename> of the subfolder <filename role="directory">home</filename> of the top level folder,
          and <filename>/home/luke/myfile.txt</filename> is the file <filename>myfile.txt</filename> in that subfolder. The
          leading <filename role="directory">/</filename> in these paths represents the top level folder.
        </para>

        <para>
          Every user has their own folder to hold their personal files and settings. This folder is called the <emphasis>home
          directory</emphasis> and is displayed in Thunar as special icon with the users login name. The folder is similar to
          the <guilabel>My Files</guilabel> folder known from Windows. The <emphasis>home directories</emphasis> of the various
          users in a system are usually located below the <filename role="directory">/home</filename> folder. For example
          <filename role="directory">/home/luke</filename> would be the home directory of the user with the login name
          <filename role="directory">luke</filename>, while <filename role="directory">/home/jane</filename> would be
          the home directory for the user with the login name <filename role="directory">jane</filename>.

          You may have already heard that everything is a file in UNIX. This is true for most objects present in UNIX systems
          today. In fact even devices are represented as a special files. While this may not make sense at first sight, it is
          one of the strengths of UNIX and its derivates, and has helped it to maintain a simple core over the years where other
          operating systems had to introduce new concepts for every new technology.

            A Symbolic link (often called a <emphasis>symlink</emphasis>) is a special file that contains a path to
            another file in the file system. Symbolic link files therefore do not contain any useful information
            themselves, but just refer to other files.

    <sect3 id="faq-executables">
      <title>Why doesn't Thunar execute files marked as executable?</title>

      <para>
        For security reasons Thunar only executes files of type <literal>application/x-desktop</literal>,
        <literal>application/x-executable</literal> and <literal>application/x-shellscript</literal>. For
        desktop files the execution feature will only be enabled if the desktop file is of type
        <literal>Application</literal> and a valid <literal>Exec</literal> line is given or of type
        <literal>Link</literal> and a valid <literal>URL</literal> is given. For the other types the feature
        is available if the file is marked executable for the current user.
      </para>

      <para>
        Also note that for <literal>application/x-executable</literal> and <literal>application/x-shellscript</literal>,
        the types of the file don't really need to match these types exactly, but it is suffice if the detected
        type has a parent that matches one of the two types listed above, or if the MIME-type is an alias for
        one of the above.

      <para>
        Thunar associates various settings with files/folders, which we call metadata.
        This metadata for all files is stored in tdb database file, which is called
        the metafile. The database file is stored in
        <filename>$XDG_CACHE_HOME/Thunar/metafile.tdb</filename> and can be examined
        using the <command>tdbtool</command>, which is part of the Thunar distribution

        the middle mouse button (usually the mouse wheel) while the mouse pointer is on the
        background area of the icon view component (any area that is not covered by
        an icon or a text). Now you can move the cursor into four directions to
        perform certain actions, which are described below.

        If you want to rebind a shortcut, Thunar supports the standard GTK+ way

    <sect3 id="faq-store-keyboard-shortcuts">
      <title>Where does Thunar store the keyboard shortcuts?</title>

      <para>
        The custom keyboard shortcuts are stored in the standard GTK+ accel map format in a
        file located at <filename>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Thunar/accels.scm</filename>. Lines starting

      <para>
        If you are a packager or a system administrator and want to provide a system wide default
        for the keyboard shortcuts, that is different from the default shortcuts in Thunar, you
        can create a file <filename>Thunar/accels.scm</filename> in one of the <envar>$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS</envar>.
        For example, if <filename role="directory">/etc/xdg</filename> is part of <envar>$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS</envar>
        (the default for most Linux distributions), you can install system wide defaults to
        <filename>/etc/xdg/Thunar/accels.scm</filename>. Thunar will then load shortcuts from this file on first startup.
