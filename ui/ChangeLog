	* ThunarBookmarksPane.py, ThunarSidePane.py, ThunarTreePane.py,
	  ThunarWindow.py, thunar.ui: Add the 'Bookmarks' tab to the
	  side pane, based on the GtkFileChooser shortcuts.

2005-02-27	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* ThunarWindow.py: Implement the `Forward' and `Back' browser
	  actions.

	* rox/: Use parts of the ROX Python libraries for the browser-like
	  prototype.
	* Main.py, ThunarFileInfo.py, ThunarListView.py, ThunarMimeDatabase.py,
	  ThunarModel.py, ThunarPropertiesDialog.py, ThunarTreePane.py,
	  ThunarView.py, ThunarWindow.py, thunar.ui: More work on the
	  browser-like prototype. It is now possible to browse your file system,
	  similar to the spatial prototype.

	* spatial/: More work on the spatial prototype, including separate
	  ListView and IconView support (IconView is only available with
	  very recent libexo-0.3 from Subversion repository). The new prototype
	  includes various ideas that were taken from the Spatial Nautilus,
	  the Spatial Finder (maybe someday I'll read the whole article) and
	  Tracker (the BeOS file manager).

	* spatial/: Imported an initial prototype for a possible spatial
	  Thunar User Interface. This has to be decided later.

2005-02-17	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* ThunarPropertiesDialog.py: Use 'Kind' instead of 'Type' to refer
	  to the MIME-type. Use full qualified application name instead of
	  the binary filename. Replace 'Adjust' with 'Change'.

2005-02-17	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* ThunarPropertiesDialog.py: Integrate the 'Applications' tab
	  with the 'General' tab, similar to `Windows Explorer'. Just a
	  try.

2005-02-15	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* .cvsignore: Make CVS ignore the compiled python files.
	* ThunarPropertiesDialog.py: Make it easier to exchange table
	  rows. Add 'Last changed:' field to the 'Permissions' tab.

2005-02-14	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* Initial import.
