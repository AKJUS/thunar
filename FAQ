This file contains a list of frequently asked questions about Thunar and the
appropriate answers to these questions.


1. What is Thunar?
==================

  Thunar is a fast and easy-to-use file manager for the X Window System, with a
  special focus on the Xfce Desktop Environment.


2. Why doesn't Thunar execute files marked as executable?
=========================================================

  For security reasons Thunar only executes files of type application/x-desktop,
  application/x-executable and application/x-shellscript. For desktop files
  the execution feature will only be enabled if the desktop file is of type
  Application and a valid Exec line is given. For the other types the feature
  is available if the file is marked executable for the current user.

  Also note that for application/x-executable and application/x-shellscript, the
  types of the file don't really need to match these types exactly, but it is
  suffice if the detected type has a parent that matches one of the two types
  listed above, or if the MIME-type is an alias for one of the above.
