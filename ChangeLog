	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-uri.{c,h}: Add thunar_vfs_uri_new()
	  constructor, that creates a new ThunarVfsURI object from a resource
	  identifier string.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-uri.{c,h}: Add thunar_vfs_uri_is_home(), which
	  determines whether a given ThunarVfsURI referes to the home
	  directory of the current user.
	* thunar/thunar-file.c(thunar_file_load_icon): Pay attention to
	  special icons for the home folder and the file system root.
	* thunar/thunar-favourites-model.{c,h},
	  thunar/thunar-favourites-view.{c,h}: Add experimental
	  ThunarFavouritesModel and ThunarFavouritesView classes, that will be
	  used in the implementation of the ThunarFavouritesPane class. Other
	  than with the mockups, I've skipped the 'Desktop' favourite for now,
	  as it does not make much sense. The usablity team should evaluate
	  this at some time.
	* thunar/thunar-window.c: Add ThunarFavouritesView on the left side
	  for testing.
	* thunar/Makefile.am: Add ThunarFavouritesModel and
	  ThunarFavouritesView to the build system.

2005-06-04	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* configure.in.in: Fix copyright texts.
	* docs/design/overview.xmi: Add is_local() and is_root() for
	  ThunarVfsURI, which were missing.
	* thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-uri.{c,h}: Implemented the missing
	  thunar_vfs_uri_is_root() and thunar_vfs_uri_parent() methods.

2005-06-04	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* COPYING.LIB: Add license text for the thunar-vfs library (which is
	  licensed under the LGPL).
	* HACKING: Add information for people that plan to hack on Thunar.
	* AUTHORS: Add Jeff Franks.
	* THANKS: Import the THANKS template.
	* README: Add some basic information about Thunar. Needs more details.
	* docs/design/overview.xmi: Import the current overview diagram for
	  Thunar.
	* Makefile.am, configure.in.in, docs/Makefile.am,
	  docs/design/Makefile.am: Include the docs/ tree with the build
	  framework.
	* configure.in.in, thunar/Makefile.am, thunar-vfs/Makefile.am: Link
	  against GThread (not yet required from what is coded so far).
	* configure.in.in: Check for several required header files.
	* thunar-vfs/Makefile.am, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-info.{c,h},
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-monitor.{c,h},
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-uri.{c,h}, thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs-util.{c,h},
	  thunar-vfs/thunar-vfs.h: Add some experimental source code to
	  implement parts of the VFS module.
	* thunar/fallback-icon.h, thunar/fallback-icon.png: Import the
	  fallback icon.
	* thunar/thunar-application.{c,h}: Import Jeff's ThunarApplication
	  boilerplate (adjusting style as required).
	* thunar/thunar-desktop-view.{c,h}: Boilerplate for the
	  ThunarDesktopView class with the very basic requirements.
	* thunar/thunar-file.{c,h}, thunar/thunar-folder.{c,h}: Experimental
	  implementation of ThunarFile and ThunarFolder based on the
	  experimental source for the VFS module.
	* thunar/thunar-list-model.{c,h}: Sample implementation of the
	  ThunarListModel class, based on an earlier implementation found in
	  Filer.
	* thunar/thunar-preferences.{c,h}: Template for the ThunarPreferences
	  class.
	* thunar/thunar-window.{c,h}: Quick-and-dirty ThunarWindow
	  implementation to be able to roughly test the ThunarListModel class.
	* thunar/main.c: Add code to start a single ThunarWindow.
	* autogen.sh: Copyright fixes. Substitute date to make it easier to
	  identify snapshots during the early development stages.
