	* mime/dump-globs-by-type.c(main): Also calculate the number of bytes
	  required to store the Literal Patterns in a memory chunk.

	* mime/dump-globs-by-type.c: Use only patterns in the form '*.ext' as
	  simple patterns, the other '*ext' patterns are considered complex
	  patterns. This allows for easier tree lookup.
	* mime/dump-globs-by-type.c: Print the number of required tree nodes
	  for the simple patterns.

2005-03-07	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* mime/dump-globs-by-type.c: Use a Memory Chunk for the ParsedPattern
	  structure to avoid heap pollution while parsing the globs files. That
	  way we can re-use the parser code later for Thunar as well.
	* .cvsignore, mime/.cvsignore: Add .cvsignore files.

2005-03-07	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* mime/mime-type-detection.xmi: Import the MIME-type detection diagram.
	  Was improved to take into account the case where no magic rules > 80
	  are present in the MIME database, which is the case by default for
	  the Shared MIME Database.

2005-03-06	Benedikt Meurer <benny@xfce.org>

	* mime/dump-globs-by-type.c: Initial import of the globs file analysis
	  tool for the Shared MIME Database.
