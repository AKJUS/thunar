Important for Thunar 1.0
========================

 - The layouting code for ThunarLocationButtons is still buggy. Problem shows
   with paths that include a very long directory; you cannot scroll to the
   last path component then.

 - A design for the ThunarTreePane framework must be developed and later
   be implemented.

 - The trash system details are mostly unclear currently.

 - The preferences must be sorted out and a suggestion for both a good
   set of preferences and a layout for the preferences dialog must be
   developed and presented.

 - A design for the ThunarDesktopView module must be developed and later
   be implemented.

 - We need a suite of unit tests and probably high-level tests, that enable
   us to test parts of the file manager automatically and isolate bugs
   early.

 - The ThunarListView class must be defined and implemented.

 - View's (and probably models) must be able to add custom actions to
   the ThunarWindow (e.g. 'Empty trash', etc.).

 - The protocol between the view/model and the ThunarWindow must be
   defined and implemented.

 - Setup gtk-doc to present developers with the internal API of Thunar
   to ease development of core modules (and later plugins).

 - Write good user documentation. Must be both precise and complete.

 - Design (UI design this time) the file properties dialog, develop
   a software design and implement it.

 - We need some easy way to manage diagrams and related developer
   information, which also includes results from discussions on
   thunar-dev.

 - The HACKING file must be updated with strict rules about how
   development of Thunar core modules is to be done, and what
   material each developer in addition to the source code.

 - The ThunarVfsMonitor framework must be designed and implemented.
   The list of supported backends for 1.0 is kqueue, fam and
   the stat-thread. Backend technologies must be thread-safe. If
   there's a lot of time or manpower in the end, additional
   backends can be added, as long as they fit into the framework.

 - The ThunarFavourites framework needs drag and drop support.
